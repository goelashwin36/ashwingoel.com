Hey this is Ashwin!

I'm a third year student of VIT Vellore pursuing Btech. in Computer Science.

Being really interested in cyber security I'm following it since my college first year. The different ways in which things can be hacked amazes me and this is what drives me deeper into this field. In the near future I would love to become a cyber security professional and help people secure their Apps and would like every develper to understand the importance of security.

Since security is a very big domain so I'm still trying to find my interest in a particular subdomain but life is very big to learn so I'm open to everything that hinders my path towards hacking and securing even the finest apps built.

Interning with Appsecco is a great honor and one of the biggest opportunity one could ever get. Being an Intern I learned the minutest of the thing which one would never pay attention to.
Majorly, I learned OWASP TOP 10, their exploitation and security as well, OSINT, Android Pentesting, Hacking VMs, Cloud Security, DevSecops.
