Hey, this is Ashwin!

As a Full-Stack developer and SWE-2 at JP Morgan Chase & Co., I am dedicated to building robust systems that drive business success. 

With AWS Solutions Architect Associate and Developer Associate certifications, I have a solid foundation in cloud architecture and development best practices. 

Whether I'm building robust backend systems or creating intuitive front-end interfaces, I pride myself on my ability to deliver exceptional results on time and on budget. 

I have also participated in Force For Good at JPMC, an initiative that aims to provide custom solutions to NGOs, where I leveraged my technical skills to make a positive impact on the world. 

In addition, I am passionate about giving knowledge transfer and training sessions, particularly on topics related to AWS Certifications, EKS, ECS, App-Mesh, and MERN Stack. 

Iâ€™ll be happy to connect and explore how you are helping drive your team's success with cutting-edge technology solutions that make a difference.
